# What makes Maxi Different?
Maxi takes into account several different factors and places an emphasize on a flexible schedule to avoid micromanging and other unhealthy/unmangeable habits.

# What does Maxi use?
1. Age
2. Habits (You wish to achieve)
3. Situation (Your personal situation and what you require)
4. Sleep/Wake Time (When you sleep/wake has a emphasize on when the AI should manage the schedule.
5. Adaptability (How adaptive you want your schedule on a scale of 0-10)
6. Our custom schedule template (Or you can provide your own if a poweruser)
7. What is healthy (What is healthy for you to do for your age personally and based on your requirements)
8. Conflicts (Previous conflicts in a schedule for example, micromanaging, demotivated, etc.)
9. Adaptive Eating Times (Whether you need adaptive eating times or not, for instance, you cannot decide when to eat or it is difficult for you to have food when you want to)

All of your responses to this will be saved to a document titled "schedule.txt" as well as the schedule generated.
